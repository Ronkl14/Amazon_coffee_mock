# Amazon mock project

This project has been made as an assignment in the Appleseeds fullstack developer bootcamp by Ron Klik.

In this project I made a mock website for a product on Amazon, the project was made with HTML and CSS.
the product page used for the project: https://www.amazon.com/Fellow-Clara-French-Press-Coffee/dp/B094WC9FXW/ref=sr_1_23?crid=29D0HB2BA5344&keywords=cold%2Bbrew%2Bfellow&qid=1673524293&sprefix=cold%2Bbrew%2Bfellow%2Caps%2C228&sr=8-23&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0&th=1

In this projects several methods have been used such as grid and flexbox.
